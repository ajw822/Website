      <description>This project was designed and assembled at Northeastern University in the fall of 2019 for my team&amp;rsquo;s EECE senior capstone design project. Included here is the abstract and associated project materials. Thanks to group members Joshua Berlin, Jess Bardio, Matan Silver, Phil Del Signore, and Lousia Beckwith as well as our advisor, Professor Bahram Shafai.
UPDATE - WACI featured in the IEEE-HKN Bridge publication The Wireless Audio Control Interface won the IEEE Eta Kappa Nu honor society&amp;rsquo;s 2020 Senior Poster competition.</description>
