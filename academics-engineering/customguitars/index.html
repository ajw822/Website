<p>One of my first experiences with soldering and workbench troubleshooting skills came from an electric guitar I received in middle school. A great deal discovered on Craigslist by my father and uncle, it was an intermediate model with a number of upgrades available on guitars five times its price. However, something was never quite right about how it sounded, and my playing wasn&rsquo;t the sole offender.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to one day during my senior year of high school, when I plugged the guitar in only to get nothing out.</p>
<h3 id="a-quick-overview-of-how-an-electric-guitar-works">A Quick Overview of How an Electric Guitar Works</h3>
