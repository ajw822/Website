<p>The Green Line Extension is headed to my neighborhood, and I wanted to celebrate as well as flex my ECE muscles. What better way to do so than to learn how to use the MBTA API?</p>
<p>I have seen projects in the past that represent transit data on some sort of hardware map. This project is my own interpretation of this idea, with hardware and software that I am creating from scratch. Some of my plans, which are currently under development, are:</p>
<ol>
<li>A map that shows the placement and status of current train cars, controlled by a custom PCB.</li>
<li>A miniature collection of overhead train status signs created using 2-line RGB LCD modules.</li>
<li>Software that takes train status using the MBTA API to control maps and displays, at this time running on a Raspberry Pi with network capabilities.</li>
</ol>
<p>If possible, I would also like to be able to estimate bus routes in my neighborhood, and maybe someday expand to traffic data.</p>
<p>I will be updating this page as the project progresses and will commit code and design files to my GitHub page. The goal of this project is to provide myself a platform for continued experimentation and development; hardware components will be abstracted so I can introduce new components I am interested in learning about (microcontrollers, etc).</p>
