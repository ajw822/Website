<p>This may have been my most active year so far, due to the not <a href="https://andrewjohnwhitaker.com/life-adventures/erie2021/">one</a> but <a href="https://andrewjohnwhitaker.com/life-adventures/gapco2021/">two</a> long trips I took this year.

</p>
<p>An interesting year for my Spotify Wrapped, since I spent most of my indoor working from home time listening to <a href="https://andrewjohnwhitaker.com/misc/vinyl/">analog media</a>. Many of these tracks were either played in the car or in anticipation of records I had on the way.</p>
<p>I managed to be in the top 1% for Steely Dan, which I suspect was the result of comparing the Spotify version of Can&rsquo;t Buy a Thrill to my lucky record store find.</p>
