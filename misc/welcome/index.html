<p>For a long time, I thought that having a personal website was unnecessary. I had managed to get multiple internships without one, and I did not see my skillset as software-heavy at the time. Over the past couple of years, however, hours spent on forums and blogs have helped me to solve many an obscure problem in my academic and professional careers. If I am able to pay it forward even to one person by writing about my experiences I would be thrilled. If not, I now have a place to keep track of my own progress and look back on where life takes me.</p>
