      <description>I am a 2020 graduate of Northeastern University, with a combined major in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Since graduating, I have been working as an electrical engineer with Lockheed Martin&amp;rsquo;s Advanced Energy Storage division in Andover, MA, which is currently focused on the Gridstar Flow line of solutions.
In my free time I am an avid bicycle tourist, amateur bicycle mechanic, and all-around tinkerer. You can find me assembling guitars, practicing the saxophone, or 3D printing when I have the chance.</description>

      <description>This website is a personal homepage.
The site is built with Hugoâ€”a static site generator made with Go. The website source code is available on GitHub. It uses the cocoa theme. The posts are written in Markdown.
The primary font face is Open Sans and the monospace font face is Ubuntu Mono. The social icons are from the Ionicons font set. CSS classes for code syntax highlighting are inserted during compile-time by Hugo using Pygments.</description>
