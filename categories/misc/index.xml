      <description>Groovy Spinning Circles I&amp;rsquo;ll start by saying that I can be a bit obsessive about my hobbies. When I say that I mean a few things:
 I could talk about them for hours on end (and sometimes do) I frequently think about what I want to do next (in other words, my hobbies usually grow in scale over time) I am a bit of an idealist when it comes to things I own (who doesn&amp;rsquo;t want their money&amp;rsquo;s and time&amp;rsquo;s worth?</description>

      <description>Here are my results from various apps&#39; year summaries, of which it seems there are more and more every year.
Strava This may have been my most active year so far, due to the not one but two long trips I took this year. During the work week I was fairly sedentary, but there is always more room for improvement!
Spotify An interesting year for my Spotify Wrapped, since I spent most of my indoor working from home time listening to analog media.</description>

      <description>Welcome Please bear with me as I get the site all set up.
 &amp;ldquo;There is much pleasure to be gained from useless knowledge.&amp;rdquo; - Bertrand Russell
 For a long time, I thought that having a personal website was unnecessary. I had managed to get multiple internships without one, and I did not see my skillset as software-heavy at the time. Over the past couple of years, however, hours spent on forums and blogs have helped me to solve many an obscure problem in my academic and professional careers.</description>
