I am a second year Electrical and Computer Engineering Student at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. I am currently pursuing a minor in Sustainable Energy Systems, and I am very interested in the evolution of the renewables sector in Massachusetts.

I am currently participating in a co-op at [Desktop Metal](https://www.desktopmetal.com); stay tuned for more on my experiences!
