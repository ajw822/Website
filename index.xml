Thanks to group members Joshua Berlin, Jess Bardio, Matan Silver, Phil Del Signore, and Lousia Beckwith as well as our advisor, Professor Bahram Shafai.

      <description>Welcome Please bear with me as I get the site all set up.
 &amp;ldquo;There is much pleasure to be gained from useless knowledge.&amp;rdquo; - Bertrand Russell
 For a long time, I thought that having a personal website was unnecessary. I had managed to get multiple internships without one, and I did not see my skillset as software-heavy at the time. Over the past couple of years, however, hours spent on forums and blogs have helped me to solve many an obscure problem in my academic and professional careers.</description>

      <description>This website is a personal homepage.
The site is built with Hugoâ€”a static site generator made with Go. The website source code is available on GitHub. It uses the cocoa theme. The posts are written in Markdown.
The primary font face is Open Sans and the monospace font face is Ubuntu Mono. The social icons are from the Ionicons font set. CSS classes for code syntax highlighting are inserted during compile-time by Hugo using Pygments.</description>
