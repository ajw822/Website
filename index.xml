      <description>Groovy Spinning Circles I&amp;rsquo;ll start by saying that I can be a bit obsessive about my hobbies. When I say that I mean a few things:
 I could talk about them for hours on end (and sometimes do) I frequently think about what I want to do next (in other words, by hobbies usually grow in scale over time) I am a bit of an idealist when it comes to things I own (who doesn&amp;rsquo;t want their money&amp;rsquo;s and time&amp;rsquo;s worth?</description>

      <description>Here are my results from various apps&#39; year summaries, of which it seems there are more and more every year.
Strava This may have been my most active year so far, due to the not one but two long trips I took this year. During the work week I was fairly sedentary, but there is always more room for improvement!
Spotify An interesting year for my Spotify Wrapped, since I spent most of my indoor working from home time listening to analog media.</description>

      <description>Applying Practical EMI Design &amp;amp; Troubleshooting Techniques December 15-16, 2021 I had the pleasure of attending a synchronized video session of Silent Solutions&#39; EMI/EMC crash course, presented by Lee Hill. This course took place over two very busy and informational days, and although the course is usually held in person, the remote version included all material and demonstrations!
I would highly recommend taking this class yourself if this is a topic relevant or interesting to you.</description>

      <title>Hand-Building Electric Guitars</title>

      <description>Intro One of my first experiences with soldering and workbench troubleshooting skills came from an electric guitar I received in middle school. A great deal discovered on Craigslist by my father and uncle, it was an intermediate model with a number of upgrades available on guitars five times its price. However, something was never quite right about how it sounded, and my playing wasn&amp;rsquo;t the sole offender.
Fast-forward to one day during my senior year of high school, when I plugged the guitar in only to get nothing out.</description>

      <title>On the topic of starting a personal website</title>

      <description>Welcome Please bear with me as I get the site all set up.
 &amp;ldquo;There is much pleasure to be gained from useless knowledge.&amp;rdquo; - Bertrand Russell
 For a long time, I thought that having a personal website was unnecessary. I had managed to get multiple internships without one, and I did not see my skillset as software-heavy at the time. Over the past couple of years, however, hours spent on forums and blogs have helped me to solve many an obscure problem in my academic and professional careers.</description>

      <description>This website is a personal homepage.
The site is built with Hugoâ€”a static site generator made with Go. The website source code is available on GitHub. It uses the cocoa theme. The posts are written in Markdown.
The primary font face is Open Sans and the monospace font face is Ubuntu Mono. The social icons are from the Ionicons font set. CSS classes for code syntax highlighting are inserted during compile-time by Hugo using Pygments.</description>
